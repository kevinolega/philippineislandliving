I got my SGM Intensity at Quiapo.

The SGM intensity is moderately heavy.

SGM Intensity is a entry level bike with entry level specifications.

I got mine for about Php 6,500.

My best friend also has one.

A common issue is the crank will fall off. We discovered that because we know four people who owned this and experienced the same issue.

### Notes:

- It's a good entry level bike.
- If you're biking 5-10 kilometers you can make do with this.
- The wheels are nice road configuration.
- Reasonably affordable.
- If you want an extra pedal, I have one. Contact me and I'll give it to you for really cheap.
- Parts I replaced include: Seat, Pedals, tires.
- If your budget is $400 and up, I recommend buying a higher tier bike.
