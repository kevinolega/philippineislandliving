My friend invited me to accompany her while shopping for... I don't really remember. I got hungry and I saw this Thai place so I decided to grab something to eat. It's interesting that more and more Thai places have sprung up in the area after the recent success of Sen Lek Thai Noodle in a lot of locations.

I tried the Pad Thai, and asked them to split the order in two plates. Here are the results.

Kua Thai is a cozy place to grab some Thai food in BF Paranaque.  It's located at Ground Floor Pergola Mall. You can find it near the Zagu and Robinson's Supermarket in BF. The food is nice and you can get a nice snack for two for a budget of Php 300-500 and add a bit more if you have a big appetite.
