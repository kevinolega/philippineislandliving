You can go to the supermarket if you want a fresh carnivore snack.

I usually get this or the Sangyupsal cuts.

But this isn't so bad.

My favorite fresh beef are from the Farm Organics.

Take a good look at the meat first.

If it's dark red, and it doesn't look dyed or something, go for it.

Observe the crew.

Sometimes they process beef and pork on the same cutting board. 

I don't like that.

Some warning.

Only eat fresh beef if your stomach is used to it.

Have maybe a few weeks of eating fresh beef before eating supermarket beef.

If it's your first time eating fresh beef, do it at home.

Sometimes the stomach is sensitive and you'll poop as a reaction.
