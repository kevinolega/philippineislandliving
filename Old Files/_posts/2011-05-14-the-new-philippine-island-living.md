I love the Philippines. But I don't like selling it. There's nothing I can do to add to it's beauty and how good it is. My best attempts only make the Philippines look cheap. Not because I suck but because something really really good doesn't need to be sold. Â Philippine Island Living will cease to be a blog that sells the Philippines.

Philippine Island Living is not:
<ul>
	<li>a travel blog</li>
	<li>a food blog</li>
	<li>a Philippine events blog.</li>
	<li>a Philippine wiki</li>
	<li>a Philippine directory.</li>
	<li>a Philippine information site.</li>
	<li>a retire to the Philippines site that invites dirty old men to make out with Filipina Girls.</li>
</ul>
Philippine Island Living is my blog and I'll do to it whatever the hell I want to do to it so fudge you for suggesting all the crap that made me realize that everyone's doing it and it sucks to do it. I'm playing around with my Philippine Island Living. It's my Philippine Island Life and I'll describe it the way it is. Love me, hate me, I don't care anymore. I just hope you have as much fun reading it as much fun as I have creating it.
