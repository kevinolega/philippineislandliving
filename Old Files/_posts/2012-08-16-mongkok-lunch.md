Me and the family went to Mongkok at Sucat Santana Grove in Para√±aque for lunch. I liked the place because the price is reasonable and it's not too crowded and would also serve as a nice place for business meetings. I used to go to their branch at the Powerplant Mall at Rockwell. The service here is just as good. They seem to close early though. 

Here's what we ordered.

I don't recall the names of the meals but they're all really good. 

Head over to Mongkok to try them for yourself.
