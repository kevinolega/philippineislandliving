If you travel often, the most common complaint would be the weight that you carry.

I hate carrying a lot of things. 

I often use way less than I bring.

I love traveling but I hate the stress I get from the heavy weight I have to carry around.

I have a few of places I travel to often.

I have two friends I visit often outside the city. I often stay there for the night or so.

I visit my family on opposite ends of the Metro.

If you're like me and you visit places overnight once a month or more, then I recommend setting up a "Bourne Box"

### What is a Bourne Box?

In the movie the Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, has a box with different passports, cash in different currencies, a gun and a bunch of tools and items he expects to use.

Think of yourself as international assassin Jason Bourne, and you need to make a quick getaway. You don't go home and pack and get your stuff. They're expecting you to be there and are waiting for you.

What do you do?

You go to the next secure hideout and you have everything you need prepared there.

Here's what I had done with the concept.

Since I already expect myself to stay overnight or for a couple of days with my friends once a month or so.

I can reduce my travel time and more importantly, travel weight by leaving a small bag at the location.

My Bourne box contains. 

- 2 comfortable shirts. 
- 2 pairs of socks 
- 2 pairs of underwear 
- A pair of shorts 
- A small microfiber towel. 
- Some toiletries.

And we're all set.

Sometimes I'll need soap so I can wash my clothes but these things are easily available in a nearby store or I can borrow from my friends.

Have you tried this lifehack before? What else would you leave in your Bourne Box? 

Send me a message and I'll add it to the post.
