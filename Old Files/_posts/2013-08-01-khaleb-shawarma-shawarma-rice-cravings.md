Shawarma rice is a version of shawarma that is served with favored rice instead of the usual shawarma bread. Here's what it looks like. <img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OAlaQMojRFo/Ue54nooXxSI/AAAAAAAAS_E/bbq_eVUBQZU/s640/2012-07-22%252018.22.43.jpg" width="640" height="480" /> One of the best places I've been to is Khaleb Shawarma. You can find it in a lot of malls and foodcourts but the nearest one in my location and the one I frequently get my Shawarma Rice Fix is in Showise Sucat. <img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WyMfXPjvQw4/Ue54nt4febI/AAAAAAAAS_A/tbfS7VKI8Qs/s640/2012-07-22%252018.22.36.jpg" width="640" height="480" />

If you tend to order two cups of rice order two of these add some chili and lots of onion sauce. Thank me later. You may also visit their site atÂ <a href="http://khaleb.com/">http://khaleb.com/</a>
