I got really lazy the past few weeks. Luckily for me I found this recipe. It's a fast filling meal that's not too expensive to make but incredibly refreshing and satisfying. 

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>
Apple. one per person. Sliced. 
Four to six lettuce leaves. Washed. 
Sliced almonds 2-3T
Lemon juice. Half. 
Olive oil. 
Salt and pepper. 

<strong>How to make it:</strong>
Wash dry then chop lettuce leaves. Add to bowl. 
Dress with lemon juice and olive oil. 
Season with salt and pepper. 
Top with sliced apple and almonds. 
Enjoy.
