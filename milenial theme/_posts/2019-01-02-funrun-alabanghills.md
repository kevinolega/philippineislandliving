It was his first time to join.

5k was tough for him.

We ended up walking and speeding up every chance we got.

I really wanted to go for it but didn't want to leave my friend.

I made that mistake in the Sun Life bike race and went after it, chasing the sprinters and finishing a few minutes behind Piolo Pascual.

The guy who won finished 5k in eighteen minutes.

That's the record to beat for next time.
