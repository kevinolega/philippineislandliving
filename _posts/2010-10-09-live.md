Living in the Philippines can be the best thing that can happen to a person. But for the people who live, love, retire and have fun in the Philippines it's a closely guarded secret.

You might have heard that "In the Philippines you need money to be happy or enjoy yourself." well that's only half true. The truth is that: "In the Philippines a little goes a long way and that's what I like about it."

Meron akong banig kasya sampu walang hihiga lahat nakatayo. -I'm selling a mattress that can fit 10 people standing up and not lying down.

Sardines/Sardinas- is a Filipino term for several people in a cramped space.

This seems like an exaggerated picture of closeness.

Another closely guarded secret: A lot of people who live in the Philippines enjoy living here and staying here. When you're not a tourist and you stay for a couple of years you'll know what I'm talking about. A little goes a long wat. Fortunately and unfortunately the local's don't know that because a lot of them would like to go abroad and experience the stress associated with living with a first world country. They might be willing to trade places with you.  Competition for thriving in the Philippines is fairly low.

Everything is cheap. The food is good. People are friendly. The view is fantastic. Life is beautiful.
