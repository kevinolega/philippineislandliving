In the beginning I had a difficult time biking from home to work and work to home. I live in Sucat and I work in Makati. I found it difficult at first but after several attempts and some adjustments to my approach and attitude I was able to accomplish what I needed to bike to work. At this point I can bike to work every two or three days. Mostly because I have a commitment to Crossfit (I'll talks about that in future posts). These days I can take the bike to work twice a week whenever I can.&nbsp;

Here are some of the problems I encountered and fears I experienced andsome adjustments that I made to &nbsp;cope so I can bike to work.&nbsp;
<b>Cars and trucks can flatten me</b>. That's a legitimate concern. At first I was always scared for my life that every time I took my bike I'd hug my mom as if it's the last time I'm going to see her. I still do. What got me over my fear of death? Surviving my first ten bike rides. I learned the skills and how to behave on the bike. &nbsp;I take roads where the speed isn't that fast and I'm okay. I look before I move and I just let whoever wants to pass me to just pass me. Stay alert and observe your surroundings and you won't be flattened. &nbsp;

<b>The pollution is too heavy</b>. I found out that wearing a mask will fix that. At first I googled the best mask for bike commuters. Many of them are worth five hundred to a couple of thousand. Turns out I can do really well with a paint mask from ace hardware for a hundred fifty pesos. That's less than four dollars and it's overkill for most bike commuters but I value my lungs and I prefer not to be protected by just cloth and foam.&nbsp;

<b>Bikes are expensive</b>. I agree with you there. Good bikes are expensive. I bought my first bike for six thousand pesos. I bought my first folding bike for thirteen thousand pesos. I bought my most recent bike for twenty five thousand pesos. You can sewer as your level.&nbsp;

<b>I might be late for work</b>. I do my best to give myself an allowance. Usually an extra thirty minutes will work. I also suggest doing a test bike to work during weekends in order to guage the travel time.&nbsp;

<b>Taking the bike is longer</b>. Based on experience it takes me forty five minutes to an hour to get to work. I find it faster than taking the bus often times.&nbsp;

<b>I'll arrive sweaty and stinky</b>. I often take my clothes to works. I have bike clothes and work clothes. I leave a few days of clothes in my locker at work. Some are at the gym. It's really important to travel light so I asked my boss for permission to leave a bag with my belongings that I would need at work to be left there so I can only travel with my dirty clothes.&nbsp;
Extras:&nbsp;

Here are some items that you might want to leave at work.&nbsp;

<ol>
    <li>Toothbrush toothpaste and grooming kit.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Your jacket or cold wear.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Your work shoes. Just change when you get there.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>An extra full set of clothes.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Some snacks.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

I hope this post helps your bike commute to be more comfortable. Please let me know about your suggestions in the comments. Thank you for reading.&nbsp;
