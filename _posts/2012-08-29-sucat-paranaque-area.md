I live in Ireneville in Sucat Parañaque City I've been staying here for a while. I grew up in the area and I'd like to share some of the reasons why this place is awesome to stay at. 


Our place is close to Shopwise and Santana Grove. 

Our place is close to BF Parañaque's commercial district. 

Our place is close to Manila Memorial Park and Loyola Memorial Park. 

Makati is an hour away and we have a bus terminal heading to EDSA or Southbound. 

Manila is an FX ride away.
