I've tried the Ketogenic diet with some success the past few years.

I've cut my waist line from 39 to 34 inches.

Here's the problem, the ketogenic diet is very difficult to follow for me.

I stay on Keto for a few months and go back to a regular Filipino Diet of rice and ulam.

I've explored the carnivore diet or the "all-meat diet" out of curiosity as I was preparing to go Keto again.

The Carnivore diet a lot like Keto but simplified.

The only thing on the menu is meat.

I've only had a couple of weeks of experience with this diet but in six days of my first attempt, I lost the usual bloat in my belly.

Test week menu:
- Gold Seas Tuna in Olive Oil
- Cheap Canned Corned beef (bad idea as this has Soy Protein)
- Hard Boiled Duck Eggs (penoy)
- Whole eggs (scrambled or boiled)

Week 1 menu:
- Gold Seas Tuna in Olive Oil
- Higer quality canned corned beef php 150 per can. (no soy protein)
- Ground beef, 200 grams(boiled or Microwaved)
- Some pork.
- Chicken and Beef liver

Week 2 menu:
- Ground beef. 380 grams
- Beef tapa
- Chicken

Next week's menu:
- Ground beef 500 grams
- Beef cubes or Tapa
- Some chicken


I'm still struggling.

My girlfriend handed me a cup of pork Kare Kare and I ate everything including the vegetables.

The same thing happened when she bough me a Mc Donalds Big Mac.

I also found myself reaching for sweets in the first few days.

Everytime I go to the gym, I found myself reaching for a protein shake, cookies and granola bars.

So if I were judging myself by Ketogenic diet rules, I have failed.

The only thing I'm proud of is that I was able to skip approximately eighteen cups of rice a week in these two attempts.

There appears to be an adaption period like Keto but the beef is satiating and I don't really feel like eating more.

I drink a little more water than usual.

I still drink coffee and tea.

I'm avoiding sauces, garlic and onions.

Today I found out that garlic is fine.

I'm happy I don't have the bloat. 

I look forward to where this experiment takes me.

Thank you for reading this far.
