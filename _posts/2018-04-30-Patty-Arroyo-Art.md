I'm a big fan of supporting local artists.

My comicbook artist friend Michael Urbano recommended I check out the art of Patty Arroyo and I loved her work after browsing through a few photos.

I even requested a Deadpool and she made it too.

She's a good person. She even gave me some drawing tips when I was starting out.

I try my best to visit her booth at a comic convention to buy a print or two. 

I got a Wonder Woman and a Super Girl.

Check out her work and you'll get what I mean.
