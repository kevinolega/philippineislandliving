This post has no photos. I haven't gotten around to using grab car until a couple of Sundays ago. It came in highly recommend by friends who take it all the time.

Because I was running late to my friend's event I decided to give it a shot.

It was a trip from Robinsons pioneer to somewhere in Pasig.

I got a ride in less than five minutes. The car was new and it felt good hopping in and arriving at the event in a nicer car. I spent somewhere around 146 for the said trip and somewhere around 240 going to Makati.

My friend who took Uber says it's a little cheaper.

It's pretty much priced the same as a cab based on my perception or maybe the amount I'm willing to pay a cab to take me to said places. Here are some differences I am happy with that I want to point out. 
1. You know the fare in advance. There is no meter running. The rate is a constant amount. You know the price before you hail the car. There's no oh shit the meter is running faster than usual or the wrong turn the cab driver made is going to set me another 50 to a hundred pesos. 
2. The drivers were all friendly and helpful. The first driver was kind enough to explain to me what happens when we call for a car through the app and what it's like working as a grab driver. The second driver was quick and polite. The third driver offered me to charge my phone when he heard that I'm almost out of battery. 
3. It feels great to go to an event in a new car for a change. I'm 30 years old now so I don't expect my dad or my uncle to drive me to events. Feeling like increasing the standard? You have the option to grab a bigger car or a nicer one. I haven't tried it yet but I look forward to if I have something fancy coming up.

Anyways if you found this post or blog useful please hit the link below. It enables you to create a grab car service account and we both get bonus credits. This helps me and you a little bit. Give it a shot and let me know how it goes.
