Carpe Diem in BF Homes has fast internet.

Before renting at the Common Space, I go there if I need to finish some work that requires a fast connection.

The staff are friendly.

The coffee is always beautiful.

I always order the Curry. It's 250ish and tastes really good. 

Good enough to be a cheat meal.

Salted egg french fries are also good especially if it's your first time buying food in a coffee shop.

I don't usually do but their dessert selection is awesome too.

Carpe Diem can be found at 143 Aguirre Acenue, BF Homes Para√±aque.
