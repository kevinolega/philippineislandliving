I created a list called Keto shortcuts.

It's a list of meals that I eat whenever I'm on a Ketogenic diet.

That way I no longer need to think about what to eat.

I just look at the list and pick one.

Or I ask Google to give me a random number and pick the dish the number lands on.

Broccoli soup

Pumpkin soup

Boiled eggs

Scrambled eggs

Stir fried Bulgogi.

Adobo.

Ground beef and tomato sauce.
