In a previous post I wrote about how <a href="http://philippineislandliving.com/zagu-makes-me-feel-good-when-im-down/">Zagu changed my mood</a>. What made my week was this part of the night. I haven't had tuna sashimi in a while and I don't have a lot of friends who don't enjoy this meal because they find it too exotic. Good thing for me, Sean was just getting off from work and I was in the area. 

There are a lot of Japanese restaurants in the Philippines however getting fresh tuna sashimi at a cheap place would require a bit of their experimentation. I love how Japanese restaurants are homey and classy when it comes to the ambiance. At times I just want to ditch the ambiance  and just go for the food because of the craving. 

<strong>Enter Sushi Boi.</strong>

Sushi Boi has been my regular source of tuna sashimi when I'm on a budget. I go to the one in Pure Gold Agora when I visit my friend Sean. 

Sushi Boi is a Japanese budget fast food that offers different kinds of Japanese food like the usual sushi, sashimi, beef rice meals and more. 

I haven't tried everything but their tuna sashimi is always fresh whenever I order and I've gone here to order tuna sashimi several times already. For Php 180 you can get 24 pieces of fresh tuna sashimi serves with Kikoman and wasabi. 

Have a craving for tuna sashimi?
