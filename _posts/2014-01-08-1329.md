Philippine Christian bookstore is a good place to find inspirational books at a lower cost. The price of good books here in the Philippines is a bit more expensive compared to other countries mostly because more of the books we read are imported. I often have to spend Php 1,000 to Php 2,000 to buy a nice book.

If you're looking for inspirational books while on a budget, Philippine Christian Bookstore has a good selection that can uplift your spirit.
