I've been buying everything from the supermarket and for the longest time I believed that the price was pretty reasonable.&nbsp; Lately,&nbsp; my friends had bought me to the Mahogany market in Tagaytay.

One of my friends had bought her beef and because of my curiosity i found out that the sirloin slices air worth Php 220 per kilo. About half the price of what they charge in the supermarket. The beef was fresh and it smells really good compared to the supermarket variant which I've been buying since I started learning how to cook. 

Oh and one last thing here's something really awesome that I found that I just had to take a picture of.

Pretty cool huh? 

So the next time you're in Tagaytay visit the Mahogany Market and get some fresh beef for a really good price.
