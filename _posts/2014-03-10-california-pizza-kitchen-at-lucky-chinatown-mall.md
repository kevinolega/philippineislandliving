I spent the most part of last year catching up with my friends visiting them where they are and trying a bunch of different food. 

For the longest time I've been seeing California Pizza Kitchen. I never got to and I've met a lot of people who tell me it's good. 

While out looking for a place to eat in Divisoria I decided to try out California Pizza Kitchen at Lucky Chinatown Malll. 

We started off with Mozzarella sticks and Carbonara and had Pizza as the main course. 

The service was amazing and the ambiance was good but for some reason the food was okay. Just okay. It didn't feel exciting or anything like that. I'm not really sure maybe I just ordered the wrong dished or its a bad combination maybe I'll give it another try in the future. 

I ended up eating most of the food. 

Here's more of what we ordered.
