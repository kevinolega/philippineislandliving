Carnivore is the ultimate minimalist diet.

I previously explored a plant heavy diet.

The first few meals I learned to put together at home are salads, and some form of vegan chilli.

I also ate a lot of buttered broccoli.

I've been eating that for several years.

Cutting down on meat mostly because of financial reasons.

Then I felt drained.

Then depression and anxiety went into overdrive.

I was always waiting for death.

I even bought a cute anime girl figure that represented death to remind me to look forward to dying.

And since I've been looking at vegan recipes on YouTube, I noticed that some people posted videos on how they stopped being vegan.

I'm aware of Paleo, Keto and All-Meat diets.

I'd like to try them but those are expensive.

My kitchen tools match Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay and Hannibal Lecter's.

I have more knowledge on spices than the regular homecook because of my meatless chilli.

But here's the thing I realized lately.

Putting together a salad uses a dozen ingredients.

Putting together a meat-less chilli requires almost twenty grocery items.

So I just said fuck it and started buying steak for Php 500 or so a kilo.

Get the pan to medium to high heat till it's smoking.

Drop the steak in.

Twenty second countdown.

Lift the steak for ten seconds.

Flip to the other side.

Twenty second countdown.

Transfer to plate.

Rest five minutes.

Then enjoy.

These days, I only use the pan.

And one large plate.

I now eat with my hands.

It feels more natural.

I don't have anything to think about anything else.

Now I'm seriously considering letting go of five boxes of kitchen tools.

Eating steak everyday is not as expensive as I initially thought.

I only eat once or twice a day.

I spend about 300-400/day on average for one or two meals.

## Some notes.

I'm not doing it for weightloss.

I'm doing it for mental clarity.

And it feels great.

Self care precedes environmental care.

The plant-eater version me just wants to brace for the incoming conflict or running away.

I don't freeze as much now when life gets stressful.

I now have this smile and press forward attitude.

I feel you can just eat any problem that life throws at you.
