</strong></em> <em>There's a story about some Nazi officials who hid in the Philippines shortly after World War 2. The story went on that they had the resources and were just biding their time and waiting for the opportune moment to bring the world to it's knees. Others say that they are fully capable of world domination. Upon arriving at the Philippine shores, receiving warm hospitality from the Filipino people and basking in the beauty of the Philippine islands the cruel cold-hearted war mongering terrorists found peace and had opted to forgo their selfish ambition and to live peacefully among the locals.</em> <em></em>

<em>
</em> Aside from the fact that the Philippines is a stunning place to live, love and retire there are other reasons to stay. The beauty of the Philippines is that it offers a fresh start. Chances are you came from a highly developed country, you've reaped the benefits but had also reaped the stress and burdens that came with it. Living in the Philippines Â also offers a fresh start and to turn on a new leaf and start over.

The beauty of a developing country is the fact that it functions with the simplicity and there are options to rid yourself of the modern complexities of everyday life.
The Philippines is not short of modern conveniences. In fact we have a lot of them as well but if you're up for adventures in simplicity the options are still available here to experiment and have fun.
No matter where you look, happiness can be found here. Opportunities can be found here. Live, contribute, develop, love, care, make friends! The possibilities are endless.
