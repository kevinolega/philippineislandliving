One challenge of the ketogenic diet is eating out. 

Filipinos love rice and eating rice is expected.

It's going to take a little trial and error but with a little patience you can get used to eating out in the Philippines on a Ketogenic diet.

Here are some tips and suggestions to eating out and following the rules of the ketogenic diet in the Philippines

### Rules I follow to Eating Keto in the Philippines

1. If you notice that the sauce is a little sweet, don't eat all of it. Just consume the meat part.
2. Get used to eating the same meals.
3. Explore until you find Keto meals.


### Eatery Suggestions Mainstream

1. Pork Sinigang. (Don't eat the gabi)
2. Bulalo
