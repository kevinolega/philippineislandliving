If you have places you travel to often. Say more than once a month it might be a good idea to set up a Bourne box there.

What is a Bourne box? 
In the movie the Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, has a box with different passports, cash in different currencies, a gun and a bunch of items he'd use.

Here's what I had done with the concept.

I have a couple of friends that I visit regularly. I usually go there and stay late and in some cases stay there for a couple of days.

My borne box contains. 
2 comfy shirts. 
2 pairs of socks 
2 pairs of underwear 
A pair of shorts 
A small microfiber towel. 
Some toiletries.

And we're all set.
