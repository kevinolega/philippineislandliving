I finally pulled the trigger.

After my bike trip to Subic.

I have been fascinated with a rider in our group who used a fixed gear bike.

He usually gets to lead at the front of the pack.

But he is easily able to slow down to check on people who are left behind and has assisted me many times.

I am afraid of fixed gear bikes.

But the more I doubted myself.

The more I wanted to try it.

I didn't buy one because I'm already paying for my bike on installment.

So as soon as I had an opportunity, I bought a frame set and decided to assemble one.

Most of the parts were purchased second hand.

The first purchase was just the frame set. The seller was kind enough for me to save up for the purchase.

The second purchase was the wheel set, which I brought from Mark, the fascinating rider during our trip.

The third purchase were the handlebars, brakes, seat post and saddle, as well as a bunch of free lights. Seller was kind enough to deliver to my house.

The fourth purchase, was the crank. Which I picked up in Laguna.

The sixth purchase was the chain, which I bought at a nearby bike store.

The fifth purchase was with the third seller. He sold me his helmet and threw in the brakes for free. Then he accompanied me to the store he got his parts from. I bought the tires, tire tube, clip-less pedals and bike shoes that match.

I assembled the bike for the 2017 Sun Life Financial Cycling Event.

### Fixed Gear First Impressions:

Fixed gear riding is difficult at first.

Don't wear clip-less pedals on the first go.

It's hard.

You are likely going to fall off your bike.

You don't need to wear your special bike shoes immediately.

Your clip-less pedals will work with regular shoes.

Compared to my [Giant folding bike](https://philippineislandliving.com/giant-fd806-folding-bike-review/) and the mountain bike, the fixed gear bike is crazy light so it is easier to go faster if you wanted to.

Climbing is incredibly easier.

The brakes were a requirement to join the cycling event but I kept it for convenience.

Downhill is a little scary for me on this bike.

I kept the brakes on because it's incredibly convenient when trying to control my speed when riding downhill.

Fixed gear riding in the Philippines, in Manila specifically is scary but doable.

Especially if you're not doing anything crazy.

Don't ever go brake-less unless you are riding in a controlled environment.

### Fixed Gear Riding Two Years Later:

I really like this bike for the lightness.

I appreciate my mountain and folding bike for what they can do.

What I love about this one is it's very light and it's incredibly easy to move around with it.

The only downside of this bike is I'm always worried that it might get stolen.

The other downside is how I feel the weight of what I'm carrying when I'm carrying a lot.

This bike is perfect if you only packed your wallet, phone, keys and maybe an extra shirt.

If you have a backpack or a messenger with a laptop, a bunch of notebooks, packed lunch, gym clothes, shoes and a jacket with you this won't be the best bike to use.
