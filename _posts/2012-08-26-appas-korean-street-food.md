I'm normally the guy who introduces new food places to my little brother this time it was the opposite. 

Traveling from Sucat to attend church at Robinsons pioneer takes a bit of toll on the belly because of the travel time. Despite leaving with a heavy breakfast we got there a bit hungry. 

My brother discovered this place as a good spot for cheap filling food. 

Enter Appa's Korean Streetfood. 

Appa's Korean Streetfood serves three dishes at the moment. Their best seller was a bowl of Tokboki which is Korean noodles served with boiled egg, rice cake and fish cake in chili sauce. They also have their own version of dimsum called Mandu. 

Budget is about 55 for the Tokboki with egg but if you want to try everything bring a hundred bucks or so depending on your appetite. 

You can find Appa's Korean Streetfood near the Robinsons supermarket at Robinsons pioneer.
