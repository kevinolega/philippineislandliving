I received this question recently about how eating a carnivore diet can be good for the environment.

> Since you eat an all-meat diet, how do you incorporate sustainability and environmental impact? Are you aware of studies about the negative impact of eating beef on the environment? 

My really short answer is:

> Exact same way as minimalism. You offset your consumption.

My friend said:

> That's the phrase I've been looking for because I wanted to explain to my friends but didn't have the words at the moment. In the case of beef, cows as a food source has the number one biggest consumption of water and that's the main reason vegans stop eating beef.
> Would u know if there are scientific studies that says otherwise or at least says that when we offset our consumption, same result with not eating meat?

My longer answer follows:

### Sustainable, responsible farming practices apply to meat too...

I guess it's true. I'm not an expert on the subject but from what I understand so far there are unsustainable practices to mass produced, factory style beef that makes it cruel to the animals and worse for the environment.

### Eating beef has many benefits and costs a LOT LESS THAN YOU THINK...

I don't do 100% all beef zero plants at the moment but when I did, I ended up eating only one or two meals a day.

Mental clarity, self-awareness, assertiveness, focus and discipline (slightly) increased when I began to eat meat. 

This increased the longer I was eating only beef.

That lead to a more productive life for me and has become the main reason why I recommend an "all-meat diet" when people ask me.

I lost weight and got stronger at the gym too.

And so on.

What's the trade off?

### You become a more competent human on the carnivore diet.

I think the main thing is I'm able to double down on the benefits that I personally want to receive for myself. These include but are not limited to:

- Help me get out of down and depressed states.
- Feel physically powerful.
- Advance my career.

### Eating more meat makes you more independent.

I also feel that it helps me resist different forms of oppression in the form of manipulation and intimidation because I found myself more aggressive and more assertive.

I also found myself regaining my ability to say no to bad deals and not backing down when I'm trying to get something for myself.

So I get all those above benefits.

### How the carnivore diet is good for the environment...  

In a perfect execution of an all-beef diet, I only require two meals a day and sometimes one meal a day.

The more extreme phase of the diet (which involves more fresh form of the) beef reduced my required daily consumption from 800 grams to 600 grams a day.

I'm sure there are more or better ways it helps but in the process, I found myself eating out less. 

Plastic cup, utensils and packaging was minimized to maybe four times a month. I still ate out but usually once a week instead of every day.

I took less supplements. I ate less junkfood and that's packaging.

I'm less depressed so I used less money to get myself to a functioning level or to feel good. I don't shop around as much to feel my need to validate my existence.

It made me feel whole in general.

As far as the water consumption goes, I don't think I'm the best person to answer it.

I'd like to say, I don't care but I'm not at that level yet, though I hope to be. One day.

But here's the thing.

Save the environment.

What is the environment made of?

It's people.

So it's not an either or decision.

As far as I'm concerned, when you take care of the individual, you can take care of the environment.

What's more sustainable? A person who owns a hybrid car or 20 people riding a 40 year old jeepney that chugs diesel and blows smoke into the sky?

Since I'm earning better, my family isn't eating as much fast food as it used to.

I'm shopping less than I used to.

And I'm happier with my life overall.

Given it more thought.

Any form of improvement helps on the long term.

**Here's an example of how the carnivore diet changed my life for the better.**

First benefit is I cut down on 90 cups of rice a day.

If I'm eating out at Jolibee that's also 90 plastic cups a day.

That's also 90 servings of ketchup or that gravy cup.

Also the 90 pairs of spoon.

90 pairs of fork.

90 pieces of straw.

A plant based diet requires some form of variety.

There'll be an average of anywhere from five to a dozen ingredients and you change your food throughout the week.

So that'll be anywhere from a dozen to a hundred small plastic bags used.

Most plant based food has packaging.

Because you're using different ingredients those come in separate bags and containers.

Next thing to consider is transportation.

Variety means those plants, fruits, vegetables and said products have to be transported from the source to the store you buy it from and it is all a separate process. It'll probably need a truck for each ingredient.

I only have beef, salt, occasional cheese and yogurt.

Five ingredients.

Five trucks. 

Five plastic bags.

Why do we have this whole zero waste and war on plastic bags/straw etc? Maybe it's the vegetable people who eat meals with a dozen or more ingredients that all came in separate bags trying to clean their own mess up.

I'll give it more thought.

I'll have to get ready and bike to the office.

One thing I wanted to say but didn't get to say is I want to meet my optimized nutritional requirements to be satisfied first before any form of paring down can happen.

One example is if I'm happy with the steak, I won't try to fill the void with potato chips, chocolate, cake and ice cream.
