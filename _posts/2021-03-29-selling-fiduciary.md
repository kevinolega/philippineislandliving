I saw this post at a group that I'm active in.

Imagine this financial pyramid.

Health Insurance at the bottom.

Life insurance at the next row up.

Pay off debt at the next row up.

Emergency fund at the next row up.

Investments at the peak of the pyramid.

Imagine this image.

Here's my response:

So bili ng health insurance, tapos life insurance, bayaran ang credit card tapos mag inpon pang emergency tapos mag invest.

Gets ko na dulo yung investment.

Pero wag mo naman ibida yung binebenta mo.

Napaka-garapal ng style. 

Kahit sinong matinong financial planner pinapauna yung emergency fund at ang pag-eliminate ng debt.

To follow ang protection and dulo ang investment. 

Wala ka bang mabenta kaya ka nagkakalat ng fake financial pyramid dito sa group na puro bata ang member?
