I get really depressed when all I do is just go to work and go home. As a remedy, I make it a point to go out and try something new and get some inspiration by changing locations. A few Mondays ago, I was invited by my friend to go for pizza at a nearby pizza place. I decided to go for my much needed dopamine release. 

Here's what we got so far. 

Brooklyn Pizza is a small pizza shop at the entrance of Tahanan Village BF. We got ourselves a cheese pizza along with bacon and mushroom pasta in cream sauce. 

Budget is around 300 per person if you're pigging out. Service is good since it's a small place and the taste is pretty good.
