It is common Practice in the Philippines to post pictures of shoplifters near the entrance of their stores. I think it would be fiting to post a shoplifter's corner near the entrance of my online home.

Since further attempts to collect or a lawsuit would be expensive, inconvenient and timewasting I decided to place this post over the internet to remind them of any debt they owe the person who complained, should they choose to google their names. It also serves as a warning for people who wish to employ the services or do business with the said individuals.

If you are in the list:

a. Several attempts have been attempted to collect have been made from you but to no avail. The complainant had been frustrated by the endeavor and would be willing to instead post your business practices online in order to get your attention.

b. Please apologize and settle your debt immediately.

c. If you choose to do so your name will be removed from the list.

d. Do not blame us from your loss of potential deals or profit.

c. Any attempt to distrupt this public service announcement will fail because our servers are located somewhere in Canda and all the content are manually handwritten using Egyptian and Jewish Dead Sea Scrolls inc on catfish skin and placed in acid-free bamboo containers and hidden inside live crocodiles in one of the 7107 islands of the Philippines by a team of mercenary Aeta Data Managers.

f. The complainant is willing to sign a quit claim waiver and is willing to do a free integrity and repentance testimonial should you pay the full amount plus an ass hole handling fee.

This list will be updated regularly and names and pictures of the said individuals will be updated as soon as they are found.
