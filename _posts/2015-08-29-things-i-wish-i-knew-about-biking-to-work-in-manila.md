In case you don't know, I bought a bike. Not just any bike. I'm on my third bike. My first bike was a cheap started bike. My second bike was a folding bike so I could take it to the bus stop, take the bus, then take the bike from the bus stop to work. My third bike was a fully upgraded mountain bike.

Rather than to give you tips on how to get started I decided to just start in the middle. I'm currently taking a break because of the rain. I took my mountain bike home from work today. Then it started to rain close to the house.&nbsp;

<ol>
    <li><b>It's easier than I think. </b>I used to think that biking is hard. It's not. It just takes practice.</li>
    <li><b>I can avoid spending money on transportation if I take my bike to my destination. </b>Yes. Biking to work and home saves me Php 120 per day that I take the bike. I'm not strong enough to take the bike yet every day because I have Crossfit commitments but I can take it every other day or every three days.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Parking is free. </b>I thought I had to pay for bike parking. I currently don't.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>I just need to travel light. </b>I am to avoid taking all the garbage I don't use with me every day. I just take what I use on a daily basis and I'm twice as happy at the results.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>A little work and my legs can bike from Paranaque to Makati. </b>And vice versa. At first it took me two hours. In my defense I didn't know the route. These days it takes me forty five minutes to an hour. Same as my commute time.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>All I need to resist pollution is a 150 peso paint mask. </b>One of the things that stopped me was my exposure to pollution which I couldn't bear.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>It's more fun than I expected. </b>Duh. You'll know it when you're doing it.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>I can make back the investment I made with my bike by deducting my daily fare. </b>See number two.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

Are you taking your bike to work?

What have you learned as you started? I'd love to hear more from you in the comments.&nbsp;
