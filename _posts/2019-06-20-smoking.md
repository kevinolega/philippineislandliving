This information helped me quit smoking.

Let's start with the summary.

Smoking is something only poor people do.

According to a few articles I've read starting with [this podcast episode](https://letsknowthings.com/episode117/).

Wealthy people have stopped smoking.

Poor people have continued smoking.

And there are far more smoking related deaths in impoverished communities than in wealthy communities.

Here's how I interpret the information.

- Smokings a poor person's activity.
- Smoking is an activity of people with lower educational status.
- If you're trying to improve your life, quitting smoking is the first thing that you can do.
- The biggest thing you can do to improve your heart health is quitting smoking and getting enough sleep. According to Peter Attia.
