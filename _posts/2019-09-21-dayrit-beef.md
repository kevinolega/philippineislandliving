Dayrit's sells the best banana cake on the planet.

I always wanted to eat here but I keep getting into a situation where  had to eat somewhere else.

We both ordered the roast beef.

It's really good.

Even if you don't eat the rice and the potato, the amount of roastbeef that you get for 380 is pretty good.

I also tried the corned beef.

I liked that it has good real parts like beef tendon and not just strips of muscle meat.

But I didn't like the seemingly extreme saltiness of the corned beef.
