I haven't moved around a lot for a while. I'm currently going out with someone I like. I'm starting to get broke. Here are some tips for great dates that don't cost much. 
1. Coffee shops and tea shops. We go to Serenitea, Cafe Bretton, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. 
2. There's a nice vegetarian restaurant in makati. 
3. There's a nice authentic Chinese restaurant in makati. 
4. Razons halo halo and dinuguan. 
5. A movie perhaps. 
6. Sometimes it's a walk around makati. 
7. Hangout in the park. The one near rcbc and Ayala triangle. 
8. See a movie. 
9. Just be together. 
10. I'll leave it to you to fill in this one.
