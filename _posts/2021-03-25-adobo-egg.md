I found myself busy with work these days.

An eatery opened near our place.

They sell rice for ₱10.

They sell most meals for ₱50.

I bought some pork adobo ₱50 and rice ₱10.

I spent ₱60.

The eatery gives a generous serving but I eat a lot.

I scrambled and fried two eggs.

At the time of this writing, a dozen eggs cost ₱110.

Scrambling and cooking the eggs takes 10 minutes.

Here's some math.

| FREQUENCY   | ADOBO+RICE | Scrambled Eggs | Total Cost |
|-------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| Meal        |     ₱60.00 |         ₱18.33 |     ₱78.33 |
| Twice a Day |    ₱120.00 |         ₱36.67 |    ₱156.67 |
| Week        |    ₱840.00 |        ₱256.67 |  ₱1,096.67 |
| Month       |  ₱3,360.00 |      ₱1,026.67 |  ₱4,386.67 |
| Year        | ₱40,320.00 |     ₱12,320.00 | ₱52,640.00 |

I'm considering if this would make sense as a meal if I'm alone and in a hurry.

Cooking the egg myself is only ten minutes.

The cleanup is considerably less than making the meals myself.

I use time to save money on the eggs.

I use money to save time by buying food.

I'm not sure if the strategy makes sense or cancel each other out.

Only time will tell.
