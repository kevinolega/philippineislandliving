Pick a smaller place than you think to save money and make the most of it.

If you want to rent a house, consider an appartment. 

If you want an appartment consider a condo. 

If you want a condo, consider a studio. 

If you want a studio consider a room. 

If you want a room consider room sharing or bedspace.

The only reason I'm getting a place to stay is for a place to stay. It's a roof over my head a place to rest and to crash when I want to sleep. I don't see much reason to stay too long at it aside from those reasons.

Do you?
