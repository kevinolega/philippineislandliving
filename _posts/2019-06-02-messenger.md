I'll start with a background of what I do.

For context.

I work remotely, so I always have my laptop with me.

Some places that I go to have really cold air conditioning so I bring a light jacket.

I bike almost all the time especially if the place I'm going to is less than ten kilometers away from my house.

I go to CrossFit so I always have a change of clothes.

**Here's what I bring on my messenger bag:**

I have my laptop.

I have my phone.

I have some form of headphones.

I have my chargers.

I have a jacket.

I have my wallet and keys.

I have a small jacket.

I have a change of clothes.

I have a pack of tissue and wet wipes.

I have a small notebook and some pens.
