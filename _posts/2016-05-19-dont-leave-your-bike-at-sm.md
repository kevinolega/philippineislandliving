Don't leave your bike at SM. It is the worst place to leave your bike. 
My bike got stolen there. It was chained and parked in front of the guard. 
The guard just said they didn't see anything. 
It was stolen and the Mall of Asia bike parking.

Previously my bike lights got stolen. The guard acted like nothing happened.
