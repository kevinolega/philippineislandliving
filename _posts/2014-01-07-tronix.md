Tronix image center is my default place to go to for ID photos.

Here in the Philippines it is common for employers and banks to require photos to be included as part of their requirements.

Tronix can be found at almost any SM Mall and Star Mall.

The package is usually Php 60. Last time I was there.

They have a combination of 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 photos.

You can also take photos to a USB and have them print your photos for you. 

I haven't done it in a while but I'm sure the offer is still available.

Tronix is really affordable so expect some queue or long lines on busy days.
