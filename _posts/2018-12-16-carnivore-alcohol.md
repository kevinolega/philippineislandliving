The carnivore diet's downside left me dumbfounded.

If you've been following my story, I attempted the Carnivore Diet back in September 2018.

[Read my story here](http://philippineislandliving.com/carnivore-diet-philippines-first-attempt/)

I started with an All Beef Diet.

I started with Canned food sources for convenience.

Then I moved to local cafeteria for my food source.

A little improvement is way better than no improvement.

Fasting is better than eating junk.

But the processed foods are better (temporarily) than quitting the way of eating and eventually eating junk for the rest of my life.

I was slowly upgrading the quality of my food choices.

I eventually ate better quality food from restautants.

Then I began preparing my own meals to save money and eat better quality food.

Around November, I got a little adventurous.

I tried the freshes sources of beef.

I ate Ribeye and Striploin fresh.

You might call it raw.

But I don't want to freak people out.

It started once a week.

Then twice.

Then my steak tartare turned into sashimi.

Then it turned into just beef and salt.

Then it's just beef.

Around middle of December I had my first cheatday.

Cheat meal.

I'm writing this in June 2019.

Memory is fuzzy.

I had my first full cheat meal in the middle of December 2018 and I started eating only Beef September 2018 and it was a Christmas Party.

And I had a little alcohol.

Fuck.

A few shots later.

Look at the photo.

That's me. 

Dead drunk.

I slept at the gym and waited till morning because I couldn't bike home.

The carnivore diet killed my alcohol tolerance.

A couple of months ago, I had dinner with a friend.

Wanting to extend our chat because our discussion got interesting, I asked if he wanted a beer.

We went to a nearby 711 and got a can each.

While chatting outside the house, I took a couple of sips.

A few minutes later I was drowsy.

Then sleepy.

Then I don't feel so well.

I excused myself from my friend and asked to reschedule our chat because I had to retire.

I didn't finish the beer.

I braved it becasuse I missed the beer and I feel guilty for throwing it out.

I managed to drink up to a third of the can.

About 100ml of beer and I'm in a grumpy mood.

Yeah.

Keto and carnivore kills your alcohol tolerance.

It all checks out.

I probably read it somewhere but ignored it.

Anyway.

That's all I wanted to say.
