We are still celebrating Carla's birthday.

After visiting Fully Booked, we went to Jamba Juice.

Stayed to test out my new notebooks.

I can't really say much about it.

Jamba juice tastes good.

But I'm trying to cut down the sugar.

So I don't imagine I'll go here often.

Maybe this will be a cheat day.

I got the Strawberry mix.
