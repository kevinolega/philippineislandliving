A couple of years ago, I set out to learn how to cook. I started reading the Four Hour Chef by Tim Ferriss and eventually watch every video I could find of Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver, Heston Blumenthal and Chef Steps. Every payday people at work buy this cheesecake dish from me and it makes a good gift if you're on a budget or don't know what a person might want.

This cheesecake dish is so amazing and so easy to make an idiot like me can create it. It involves a little bit of trial and error but over time it's going to be perfect.

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cream Cheese</strong> 550 grams or two 225 gram packs. I use Emborg and/or Swiss Valley.</li>
    <li><strong>Eggs</strong> Three large</li>
    <li><strong>Caster Sugar</strong> the original Gordon Ramsay's recipe says 160g but I find it to be too sweet I reduced the sugar and 70-80 grams is just perfect.</li>
    <li><strong>Flour</strong> Three Table spoons.</li>
    <li><strong>Oreos </strong>1 pack</li>
    <li><strong>Lemon Zest </strong>Between 1/4th and 1/3. You can put in more but I find it too strong.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tools:</strong>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Mixing Bowl</strong>Large enough that the ingredients don't spill.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk or Elextric Mixer</strong> I've used both and the electric is more consistent you can go manual if you want a more home made rustic feel.</li>
    <li><strong>Bakable Containers </strong> I use the kind that has a non stick lining inside</li>
    <li><strong>Baking Tray. </strong>Just a plain one.</li>
    <li><strong>Thermometer. </strong>So you don't burn these babies.</li>
    <li><strong>Weighing Scale. </strong>If you don't have one. Get your ingredients weighed at the store you got them from.</li>
    <li><strong>Microplane Zester </strong>for the lemon.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Preparation:</strong>
1. Leave the cream cheese outside the fridge for a couple of hours or so so it goes to room temperature. Cream cheese is difficult to mix if it's hard from the fridge especially if you're doing things manually.
2. Do the same with the eggs.
3. Separate the oreo's into two and put one at the bottom of your container.

<strong>Steps:</strong>
1. Mix the cream cheese, the eggs and the flour together until the mixture is consistent. Add and mix in the lemon zest at the end.
2. Add the cream cheese mixture in the middle. fill your container to about 60-70% or roughly 2/3 because the mixture tends to rise because of the flour. Top with oreo.
3. Bake 180c for 15 minutes.

<strong>Notes:</strong>

<ol>
    <li>I made it cupcake sized so it cooks faster.</li>
    <li>Once you notice the sides beginning to brown take the cheesecake off the heat.</li>
    <li>I ended up reducing the sugar to 65-70 grams and it still tastes perfect.</li>
</ol>
