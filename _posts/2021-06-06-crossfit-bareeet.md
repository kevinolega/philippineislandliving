I’ve been wearing Reebok Nanos 2, 4, 6, and 8.

I also started wearing Metcon 2’s recently. 

I've used my shoes for workouts.

I've also used my shoes for walking around and going out.

I noticed that my feet hurt when I’ve walked for over three hours. 

One day, I decided to take out the soles and tried my CrossFit shoes on. 

Both my Metcon 2 and my Nano 8 began to feel like barefoot shoes. 

I’ve been wearing my CrossFit shoes longer and I’m happy with the results. 

I even worn my Nano 8 to a street kickboxing session and I've completed my workout without any issues.

If your feet are hurting a little from wearing your CrossFit shoes or if you prefer wearing barefeet shoes, you can convert your CrossFit shoes to barefeet shoes by removing the soles.

You're welcome.
