I go to Izakaya Kikufuji for their generous serving of salmon sashimi.

They are mostly known for the Special California Maki.

The special California Maki is like taking the humble California Maki to level 99. 

It has almost exactly the same ingredients but you get larger mangoes, topped with spicy tuna sashimi and salmon roe.

Salmon roe pops into your mouth as you bite into them.

This is one of my favorite cheat day spots.
