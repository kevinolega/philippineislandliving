The Iglesia ni Cristo is a local religious group that is founded in the Philippines and has a large following. 

I'm not a member of this group.

I do find the design of their churches facinating.

It's beautiful and almost all are identical.

I don't have a lot of info from their group but I find it interesting that all their churches practically have the same design but vary in sizes and sometimes color (if I remember correctly).

When I was a kid the Iglesia ni Criso church is the closest thing to me as the Disney Castle and I've always wondered what's inside or how things go. 

Moving on, on the drive to a party in Calamba, Laguna we saw the smallest Iglesia ni Cristo Church I've ever seen.

We wanted to take a picture but we were too far ahead when we realized that it's the first time we saw a church as small as the one we passed by.

On the way back, we took a photo and it's amazing that a tricycle was parked in front which helps us get an idea on the actual size.

What's the smallest Iglesia ni Cristo Church you've ever seen?
