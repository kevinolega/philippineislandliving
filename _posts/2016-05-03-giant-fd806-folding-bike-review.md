I got the Giant FD 806 folding bike as an impulse buy. I wanted a folding bike so I can go bi-modal for my Parañaque to Makati commute. After looking at all the bike shops in Pasong Tamo this bike was the best I could buy for my budget. I used it for a month, got tired and stopped.

I then tried again but it felt it was more trouble than it's worth.

Don't get me wrong, I love using this bike but if you intend to use this bike to commute for 15km straight I wouldn't recommend it.

This bike can take some abuse. I took it to Makati but because it was rush hour, I couldn't find a bus that would give me a ride mostly because it's full of people and I ended up riding it all the way to Parañaque then I got invited by a bike group to join them as we rode back to the Fort, Makati and the final stop is in Manila then back to Parañaque.

I also took this bike from Parañaque to Makati then Mandaluyong to Marikina to Cainta.

The bike holds up in long range rides 30km a day or so better than I expected. It's true that small wheels require you to pedal more and the ride is slower if you compare it to my mountain bike but the ride is comfortable enough that I don't notice.

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<ul>
<li>It's a beautiful bike.</li>
<li>It has the mud guards and rear carrier built in.</li>
<li>6 speed doesn't feel like a lot but when you are using them well you're fine with it.</li>
<li>Small and feels good to ride. You can maneuver through the traffic well.</li>
<li>The seat is really comfortable.</li>
<li>Pretty good on uphill and riding up the building parking lot. Just don't forget to gear down.</li>
<li>Adjustable and really comfortable seat. My butt never hurt riding these even if I'm on a two hour ride.</li>
<li>Cute bell.</li>
<li>Folding pedals. Nice for storage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>

<ul>
<li>Not too fast on straight paths.</li>
<li>Not as light as I wanted it to be. I have tried lifting it while on a bus to get off and I pulled my back muscles on two different occasions.</li>
<li>Handlebars fold slower because you have to turn it to loosen the handlebar.</li>
<li>It's not steady when folded.</li>
</ul>

<h4>One Year Later</h4>

I still use it often for short trips.
I bought myself a rear carrier bag and use that a lot. The advantage of a rear carry is you can bike without a backpack or a belt bag. This doesn't restrict your breathing and everything feels lighter. The downside is that you have to remove it every time you'll leave your bike.
I tried removing the rear carrier and the mud guards this summer. It felt that the bike got lighter but not that much difference. The place I live in has anti flood walls so I'll need to lift the bike a few times to get it inside the house and I don't feel that much different carrying the bike without the mud guards and the rear carrier.

<h3>Should you buy it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>For short distance rides about 5-10km -- it's a good bike.</li>
<li>For bike commute that involves taking it to a bus or a train it'll be more trouble than it's worth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommendation</h3>

The FD 806 is heavier than I wanted it to be.

The bike is beautiful. I get a lot of compliments.

The price of the bike is close to double of most of the cheap folding bikes that weighs the same. I really couldn't tell the difference.
My friend tells me that with Php 14,000 I could have gotten a Doppelgänger or paid a little bit more for a Dahon.

<h3>Some tips:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Buy a helmet. If you have extra budget get yourself a nice helmet with a built in rear light so you can be seen at night.</li>
<li>Buy a bike pump.</li>
<li>Invest in a tire repair kit.</li>
<li>The stock version doesn't come with quick release for the wheels get yourself a 15' wrench.</li>
<li>Buy a front and rear light. The cheap ones will do fine. Don't forgeT to</li>
<li>Buy a bike lock. The U-Lock is the best but the good ones are expensive. I get by with a Master Lock.</li>
</ul>
