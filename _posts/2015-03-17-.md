I've been working seven days a week straight for a few months now. I had one off and will have to go on another six day workweek marathon. I was trying to save for something. I got the money but I hated my life. Exceeding a 40 hour workweek has a toll on me and I become really negative. I realised I needed to decompress. It was my rest day yesterday and I bumped into a friend who had nothing else to do that day. I wanted to go out for a trip in a while so I called Ralph. I asked him if he wanted to drive to Tagaytay and I'll cover the costs. He's up for it so Tricia and I took a bus ride to Bicutan to pick up Ralph and Kaye.

Here's the itenerary.
- Trip to Tagaytay. Enjoy the view and fresh air.
- Stop at Mahogany Market for Bulalo. It's also a nice place to buy plants, herbs and beef. I bought 3 pots of thyme and two pots of tarragon.
- Chill at Java Jazz. A cozy coffee shop that's sort of a haven for local artists. Local artwork is on display for everybody to enjoy.

Here's the breakdown of what we spent.
We spent Php 700 for gas
We spent Php 20 each for fishballs squid balls and kikiam.
We spent another Php 30 for street fried squid.
We spent Php 600 for one bulalo and Tawilis and rice at the Mahogany Market split four ways.
We spent Php 99 each for a drink at Java Jazz.

I recommend going on a Monday or a Tuesday so there' absolutely no traffic.

My friend Ralph can take you on the same trip. Just throw in an extra $50 or Php 2,500 on top of the gas. Please contact me at 63 917 895 2637 so I can schedule you.
