This is one of my (and my mom's) favorite spots to enjoy good food. This is seemingly invisible place in the middle of Shopwise Sucat, just between the meat and vegetables section. Le Gourmet is a deli, a coffee spot, a sort of sandwich shop and a salad bar all rolled into one. It’s the kind of place where you can get food that’s served in upscale restaurants for a fraction of the cost. Here’s what we ordered tonight.

I got excited and took a few small bites before I took the photo.

A meal like this would cost less than Php 200 but that’s not all that you can get.

A beef pastrami sandwich complete with veggies and condiments is just Php 50.

A Frankfurter (sausage) would be Php 60 and they’ll heat and slice it up for you.

A large serving of German Cream Cheese for under Php 100

A decent serving of potato salad is just Php 60.

One or two would be just a bit over a hundred. A real restaurant, from my experience charges a lot more.

You can get different sorts of ham, cheese, sausages and meat here so be sure to check it out.

The best part? You can either buy it as part of your groceries and prepare it at home or if you’re like me, you can have their staff prepare the meal for you.

Here are some pictures so you know what’s available:
