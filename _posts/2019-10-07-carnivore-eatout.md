Who says it's difficult to eat out when you're eating health (Keto, Paleo, Carnivore)? 

Actually a lot of people.

Myself included.

So after spending some time thinking of the solution, here's what I came up with.

## Carnivore Food Heirarchy

From most filling to least filling.

1. Beef
2. Lamb
3. Pork
4. Chicken
5. Fish

## Basic Rules

1. Don't drink the sauce.
2. Although beef is the best, lower tier item are way better than eating junk food.
3. You are not required to eat everything. Give the rice and vegetables to someone else.

## Matty's Tapsilog place

I live near a Matty's branch.

I know it's considered fat food and they use plant-based cooking oil and there's some sugar in their food but for convenience, I eat here.

I order Tapa, Egg, Dinuguan.

Some days, I order Kaldereta or Nilaga.

Dinuguan is a traditional Spartan dish so it feels great to eat it.

When I feel I need to eat more, I order sisig or barbeque.

## Filipino Food

Filipino food has a lot of options for canivore. In a lot of cases, I order Nilaga, Sinigang and Bulalo and just skip the vegetables.

Whenever possible, I order Krispy Pata, Liempo, Lechon.

To overcome boredom from eating the same meals over and over again, I order uncommon Filipino foods when available like Papaitan, Dinakdakan and sometimes Sisig.

Sometimes these are not available and I don't like wasting food so I order Filipino dishes with the least amount of carbs.

I also end up ordering full dishes instead of the rice meal options.

## Roast

I like roasts because these are convenient and economical.

You pay a little more upfront and you have more servings.

At the time of this writing, a whole roast chicken from Andoks, Baliwag, Ramboys is about 250-270.

I get roast chicken or pork depending on what I feel like eating.

My only problem with eating chicken or beef is I'm usually hungry sooner in the day.

I'm still exploring roast beef options.

## Persian Food

I get my Persian fix at Behrouz, Shawarma Snack Center and Uncle Moes and often in that order.

Ox Brain is my primary go-to food. I order two of these.

Keema just ground beef and some tomatoes. I order these or Kebab. 

Kebab is just ground beef and some spices. I usually order these or Keema. 

Khorma is a Persian version of kaldereta with more spices and I like this a lot.

## Chinese Food

I order chicken feet and spareribs.

I get asado, lechon macau, or any meat dish.

## Korean Food

I just eat the plain beef cuts from Sangyupsal and ocassionally kimchi.

## Supermarket 

Whenever I feel like eating fresh meat I check the supermarket if they have fresh good quality meat.

If good meat is available, I get ribeye or beef cubes.

## Convenience Stores

I get good quality canned corned beef (don't get the cheap stuff) or pork rinds from 711.

## Japanese Food

Japanese food is primarily my cheat meal and is the only place I end up consuming carbs at.

I primarily eat some form of curry rice dish here but it's not carnivore.

But when I'm at a good place, it's usually salmon sashimi for me.

## Others

If I'm out, I just order the meat dish.

If the price is good, I order steak.

I only get salmon sashimi and beef and lamb at all you can eat buffets.
