This is my second time renting for a longer term at the Common Space.

The first one was from a year ago during summer.

Summer is pretty hot in the Philippines and unfortunately, my small air conditioner in the room won't do.

**The Common Space has:**

- a friendly staff
- fast internet
- cold air conditioners
- the owner responds to the facebook posts 
- they are easy to deal with
- it's own pantry with a fridge, microwave and sink
- dedicated CR with bidet
- outlets on all the space
- meeting room for presentations

**Common Space Rates:**

- Php 200 for three hours
- Php 300 for whole day for students
- Php 400 for whole day for professionals
- Php 4,000 a month unlimited use from 9am-9pm.

There are twelve or so tables with multiple seats that you can go to each has a unique appeal.

Whether you're in to working at a traditional desk, a cubicle type working area, a dinner table style space, a restaurant style booth, a bar style standing desk or just a large table with outlets.

Did I mention that they have outlets on all the space?

You never have to worry about extensions to plug in.

It's usually on a first come, first serve basis.

I like to move around.

All the areas are equally good.

If you get distracted easily or you're having a bad day.

Pack up and restart at a different area at the Common Space.
